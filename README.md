# VIS_Game_Boy_DMG
![image](images/VIS_DMGs.jpg)
This project was born with the aim of saving corroded boards of **Gameboy DMGs** or **SNES Super Gameboy adapter**s. For this reason, I developed replacement PCBs by using modern electronic components. Several exisisting DMG mods are included:
- **Lipo power board** that also provides the negative voltage required for the **original LCD** (this voltage can be turned off through a switch if an **IPS screen** is used). Thanks to a **brand new 2.5A DC jac**k, a lipo battery can be safely charged at 0.5 or 1 A. In addition, it is possible to **play while charging** by using only the current coming from the DC jack.
- **Audio board** with all the audio circuits on it in which **1w speaker** or the **original speaker** is directly connected (Audio is not sent to the front PCB, and, for this reason, any power absorbing on the front PCB does not affect audio). Audio amplifier can be disabled to save battery life or to use only the pro-sound jack.
- **Integrated bivert chip**.
- I also developed a **replica of the OSD IPS (v4 or v5) board** with **button LEDs** and **tactile buttons**.
