# VIS_Game_Boy_DMG
![image](images/VIS_DMGs.jpg)
This project was born with the aim of saving corroded boards of **Gameboy DMGs** or **SNES Super Gameboy adapter**s. For this reason, I developed replacement PCBs by using modern electronic components. Several exisisting DMG mods are included:
- **Lipo power board** that also provides the negative voltage required for the **original LCD** (this voltage can be turned off through a switch if an **IPS screen** is used). Thanks to a **brand new 2.5A DC jac**k, a lipo battery can be safely charged at 0.5 or 1 A. In addition, it is possible to **play while charging** by using only the current coming from the DC jack.
- **Audio board** with all the audio circuits on it in which **1w speaker** or the **original speaker** is directly connected (Audio is not sent to the front PCB, and, for this reason, any power absorbing on the front PCB does not affect audio). Audio amplifier can be disabled to save battery life or to use only the pro-sound jack.
- **Integrated bivert chip**.
- I also developed a **replica of the OSD IPS (v4 or v5) board** with **button LEDs** and **tactile buttons**.

**Before I go any further, please read this VERY important disclaimer if you are thinking about making this yourself.**

If you choose to build this project yourself, be warned - this is a considerably advanced and expensive build. You must be comfortable with the fact that you may lose or damage expensive components. **You are 100% liable for any damage done to your property or yourself. I am not responsible for any damage or loss of property incurred while attempting this project or after completion of the project - you alone accept all risk.** While I am confident in this design, I cannot claim full compatibility with every system configuration. And there may be latent issues that have yet to crop up. I will update this repo if I encounter any, and if you see anything I may have missed or some dubious design choice, feel free to ask questions or comment as such. Corrections are welcome. However, I **will not** obligate myself to provide tech support. You accept all risks and costs associated with this build if you choose to attempt it.

**DO NOT attempt this project if you are uncomfortable or inexperienced with detailed electronics troubleshooting or are not proficient in soldering! You will, AT MINIMUM, need to be proficient in drag soldering and hot air reflowing. If you have not gained proficiency in these soldering skills, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS PROJECT.**
