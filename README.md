# VIS_Game_Boy_DMG
This project was born with the aim to save corroded boards of Gameboy DMGs or SNES Super Gameboy adapters. For this reason, I developed replacement PCBs by using modern electronic components. Severals exisisting DMG mods are included:
- Lipo power board that provides also the negative voltage required for the original LCD (some voltage can be turned off through a switch if an IPS screen is used).
- Audio board with all the audio circuits on it in which 1w speaker or the original speaker is directly connected (Audio is not sent to the front PCB and, for this reason, any power absorbing on the front PCB does not affect audio). Audio amplifier can be disabled to save battery or to use only the pro-sound jack.
- Integrated bivert chip.
- I developed also a replica of the OSD IPS (v4 or v5) board with button LEDs and tactile buttons.
