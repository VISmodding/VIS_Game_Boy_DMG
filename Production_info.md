# Production information

## Mainboard Gerber file

Produce the mainboard Gerber file with 1 mm thickness (I suggest ENIG surface finish). Here you have 6 designs, and the various PCBs can be easily separated along holes.

## Audio Jack raiser Gerber file

Produce Audio Jack raiser Gerber file with 1.6 mm thickness. Here you have 4 designs that, once printed, must be separated (they are very fragile and break easily). 
I used a panelized Gerber file, and hence, when produced, you will have a lot of these very little boards. Since these boards are very small, when ordering, specify 
that you will accept all the risks during production.

Produce the IPS front PCB Gerber file with 1.2 mm thickness (I suggest ENIG surface finish).
